Find the Median
===============

###Problem Statement

In the Quicksort challenges, you sorted an entire array. Sometimes, you just need specific information about a list of numbers, and doing a full sort would be unnecessary. Can you figure out a way to use your partition code to find the *median* in an array?

###Challenge 
Given a list of numbers, can you find the median?

###Input Format 
There will be two lines of input:

* n - the size of the array
* ar - n numbers that makes up the array

###Output Format 
Output one integer, the median.

###Constraints

* 1≤n≤1000001
* n is odd
* −10000≤x≤10000,x∈ar

###Sample Input
```
7
0 1 2 4 6 5 3
```
###Sample Output
```
3
